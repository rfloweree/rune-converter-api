/**
 * Object to create a Parser Factory for a specific parser family. Parser 
 * families are based on language character representation or different 
 * variations of the same alphabet used within the language.
 * 
 * E.g. Khuzdul, dwarvish language, uses the Cirth rune system, but there two
 * rune systems, Erebor and Moria. Each is treated as a separate parser.
