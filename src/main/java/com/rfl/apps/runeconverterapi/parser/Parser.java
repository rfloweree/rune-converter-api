/**
 * Parser Object that will convert as string into a context sensitive letter 
 * representation. 
 * 
 * This works like a basic substitution algorithm for alphabet encryption. 
 * However it dose not use shift order mapping and is customized based on 
 * different parameters.
 * 
 * Note: A parser is a one direction substitution. This means that it only 
 * converts the string in one direction of encryption, i.e. Plaintext to mapped 
 * context. A sister parser will need to be created to handle the reverse 
 * encryption of the mentioned example.
